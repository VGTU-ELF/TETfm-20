As our instructor offered the class only these two files, I guess he means Windows-based `Seamcat` setups only:
```
.../118110/mod_resource/content/1/seamcat.msi  
.../118111/mod_resource/content/1/jxpiinstall.exe  
```

Of course which some students cannot handle because of the different OS they use (eg. Chrome OS, or CentOS Linux).

Thus [@saulius-krasuckas](https://github.com/saulius-krasuckas) is about to investigate the way to run `Seamcat` on CentOS.

### Finding the downloads

So, as you go to the https://www.seamcat.org/, you get redirected to CEPT homepage:  
https://cept.org/eco/eco-tools-and-services/seamcat-spectrum-engineering-advanced-monte-carlo-analysis-tool

Here, in the **Download** subsection you will be asked for registration, but I guess that isn't strictly required.  
You should access downloads directly here:  

https://www.seamcat.org/download/

Here is the file list as of `2021-01-06`:
