As our instructor offered only these two files, I guess he means Windows-based setups only:

https://moodle.vgtu.lt/pluginfile.php/118110/mod_resource/content/1/seamcat.msi  
https://moodle.vgtu.lt/pluginfile.php/118111/mod_resource/content/1/jxpiinstall.exe  

Which of course some students cannot handle (because of different OS they use, eg. Chrome OS, or CentOS Linux).
