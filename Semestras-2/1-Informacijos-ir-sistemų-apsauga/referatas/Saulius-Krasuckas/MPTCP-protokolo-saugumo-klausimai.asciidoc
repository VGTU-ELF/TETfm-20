Multipath routing causes cross-path data fragmentation. From a security perspective that challenges in-line security solutions (e.g., firewalls, IDSs, and malware scanners) which only "see" one path's traffic. Without being able to see all paths, these devices may miss activity that they're meant to be monitoring for. These intermediary devices act a bit like an airport body scanner for the passengers wanting to enter the airport gate area.
