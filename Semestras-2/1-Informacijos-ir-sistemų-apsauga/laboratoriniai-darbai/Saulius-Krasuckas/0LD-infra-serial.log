NAME
       /etc/network/interfaces  - network interface configuration for ifup and
       ifdown

DESCRIPTION
       /etc/network/interfaces contains network interface configuration infor‐
       mation  for the ifup(8) and ifdown(8) commands.  This is where you con‐
       figure how your system is connected to the network.

EXAMPLE
       The following  example  configures  two  network  interfaces:  eth0  is
       brought  up at boot, and uses DHCP for IPv4 and SLAAC for IPv6, whereas
       eth1 is brought up whenever the network hardware is  detected,  and  is
       configured with static IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

       auto eth0
       allow-hotplug eth1

       iface eth0 inet dhcp

       iface eth0 inet6 auto
